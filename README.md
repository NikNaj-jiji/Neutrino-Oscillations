# **Neutrino Oscillations: Numerical Study and Coupled-Pendula Analogy**

Neutrino oscillation simulations showing flavour–mixing and the need for neutrino mass. Includes PMNS mixing, CP-violation overview, and a coupled-pendula analogue to illustrate eigenstate mixing.

### **Folder Descriptions**

**`report/`**
Contains the full written project report, including:

* motivation from the solar neutrino deficit
* derivation of oscillation probabilities
* role of mass eigenstates and flavour mixing
* overview of the PMNS matrix and conceptual CP violation
* physical analogy using two and three coupled pendula

**`notebooks/`**
Jupyter notebook implementing and visualising:

* equations of motion for two coupled pendula
* equations of motion for three coupled pendula
* numerical solutions using `scipy.integrate.odeint`
* plots illustrating energy exchange and normal modes

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   `notebooks/coupled_pendula.ipynb`

2. Run all cells to:

   * solve coupled-pendulum equations
   * visualise oscillatory behaviour
   * explore how the analogy relates to neutrino flavour mixing

3. Read the PDF report for the full theoretical background.
